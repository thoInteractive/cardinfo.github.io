When I tried to register my Amex Gold Charge card for above offer I got an error message saying _"Unfortunately this campaign is by invitation only."_ I was little perplex as I received the invitation email. However when I looked at the email carefully, the offer was for my Amex Gold Credit Card.

{% include tip.html tip="If you hold multiple Amex cards, register the card whose last five digits match with the one mentioned in email."%}

After entering the details of my Amex Gold Credit Card, I was able to register for the offer successfully. Earlier in past, I was able to register for offers even though I didn't receive the email. However now it seems Amex has put stricter norms in place for availing their offers.

**PS:** If you don't have Amex, you can apply via my referral link below. Signing up using this link will give you card **free** for first year and **2000** extra referral bonus reward points in addition to **2000** bonus reward points which is not available otherwise.

_Anyways, 10% cashback on such big brands is definitely a fabulous offer from Amex. What do you think?_
