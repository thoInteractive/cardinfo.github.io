This is a quite lucrative offer as it gives back as high as 16.67% in form of Amazon vouchers. Only downside is HSBC uses Merchant Category Codes (MCC) issued by Visa/MasterCard for determining the categories. Since MCC is not revealed by merchants, you can never be sure if your spending across all three categories to qualify for this offer.
