I'm ecstatic that 10X rewards on HDFC Diners Club Credit Cards is extended till end of June 2019. But I think this may be the last time with 10X reward points. They may renew the offer with reduced reward rate afterwards.

_Are you happy with new 10X partners? How long do you think HDFC is going to renew this offer? Let me know in comments._
