This is an entry level lifestyle card with low annual fees and slightly better rewards than some of the existing cards.

#### Bottomline

Ola Money SBI credit card seems to be a well balanced card for beginners. It's definitely better than Paytm First credit card, however I'll still rate [Amazon Pay ICICI Bank credit card](/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-review/) better than this owing to latter being life time free and better reward rate on Amazon Pay partner merchants.
