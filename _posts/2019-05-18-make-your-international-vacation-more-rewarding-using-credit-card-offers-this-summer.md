### HDFC Bank Debit Card

HDFC Bank is providing Rs. 1000 cash-back on cumulative international spends of Rs. 25000.

- **Offer**: Rs. 1000 cash-back on cumulative international spends of Rs. 25000
- **Period**: Till 31 May 2019
- **Type**: Targeted, applicable only if you received communication over email or SMS
- **Fulfillment**: Cash-back is earned in form of Cash-back points where 1 Point = 1 Rupee, cash-back point should be posted within 90 days after the offer end date, cash-back point needs to be redeemed via Net Banking (Cards > Debit Cards > Enquire > CashBack Enquiry and Redemption > Account Number > Continue > Input the CashBack amount) or Phone Banking
- **Source**: [Website](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com/offer_details/12832)

Given that you need to pay 3.5% (plus 18% GST) as foreign currency markup fee, this offer will just cover the markup fees. Hence, if you don't have other cards with low foreign currency markup fee, use this to compensate the same. Also the cash-back redemption process is little tedious and HDFC Bank should have credited the cash-back amount directly to card instead of customers redeeming it via Net Banking. This is a classic example of how you shouldn't do cash-back offers on card. HDFC Bank, are you listening?

### Yes Bank Credit Cards

Yes Bank is providing 10% cash-back on all international dining spends using their credit cards.

- **Offer**: 10% cash-back on international dining spends
- **Period**: 4 May 2019 to 31 May 2019
- **Maximum cash-back**: Rs. 1000
- **Type**: Applicable on all Yes Bank Credit Cards
- **Fulfillment**: Cash-back for eligible transactions would be posted by 30 June 2019
- **Source**: [Website](https://www.yesbank.in/pdf/terms_n_conditions_international_dining_spends_pdf)

Though a maximum cap of Rs. 1000 is little disappointing, I feel expenditure of Rs. 10,000 on dining would suffice most budget travelers. Also note that Yes Bank Exclusive credit card has lower foreign currency markup of 1.75% (plus 18% GST) compared with other credit cards in market which charge around 3.5%. Also, if you hold Yes First Exclusive Card, you will get 3% reward points on dining category. Hence the net rate of return boils down to **11%** (10% cash-back - 2% foreign currency markup + 3% reward points) which is quite awesome.

### RBL Bank Credit Card

RBL Bank is waiving off entire transaction charges on international purchases.

- **Offer**: 100% Waiver on transaction Charges for all international purchases
- **Period**: 4 May 2019 to 31 July 2019
- **Maximum waiver**: No limit
- **Type**: Applicable on all RBL Bank Credit Cards
- **Fulfillment**: Waiver of charges will be automatically adjusted during monthly statement generation
- **Source**: [Website](https://rblbank.com/api/v1/doc/document/offer-pdfs/terms-100per-offer-15may19.pdf)

Given that credit cards normally charge foreign currency markup of 3.5% (plus 18% GST), this offer saves you **4.13%** and no upper limit is cherry on top. Also you continue to earn normal reward points on your card.

### Kotak Credit Card

Kotak Mahindra bank is providing 5% cash-back on all international spends.

- **Offer**: 5% cash-back for all international purchases
- **Period**: 3 May 2019 to 15 July 2019
- **Maximum Cash-back**: Rs. 5,000
- **Minimum Spend**: Rs. 50,000 or more in a single bill
- **Type**: Applicable on all Kotak Credit Cards, to participate register through SMS by sending "KABROAD" to 5676788
- **Fulfillment**: Cash-back would be credited to cardholders' account within 90 days post the Offer Period end date
- **Source**: [Website](https://www.kotak.com/en/offers/offer-details/1234544987/get-5-cashback-on-all-international-transactions.html)

Well minimum spend of Rs. 50,000 or more in a single bill is a bummer. Also you need to shell out the foreign currency markup fee of up to 3.5% (plus 18% GST) which makes this offer even less enticing.

### IndusInd Bank Credit Card

IndusInd Bank is providing Flipkart vouchers worth Rs. 1000 when you spend Rs. 50,000 or more on travel category (Airlines, Railways & Hotel).

- **Offer**: Rs. 1000 Flipkart vouchers on spend of Rs. 50,000 or more on travel category (Airlines, Railways & Hotel)
- **Period**: 1 May 2019 to 31 May 2019
- **Type**: Targeted, applicable only if you received communication over email or SMS
- **Fulfillment**: Flipkart vouchers will be emailed by 31 July 2019 to eligible card members
- **Source**: [Website](https://www.indusind.com/content/dam/indusind/PDF/SummerFiesta-2019-20-MCOTOFV.pdf)

Note that is not a international spend offer and hence you can use this for domestic travel spends too. The T&C says "Summer Fiesta-Mastercard Travel Offer" and hence I believe it's applicable only on Mastercard variant of IndusInd Bank credit cards. This offer is over and above your existing reward rate and hence finally it translates to **2.5%** (assuming 0.5% of base reward rate) or more depending on card you hold.

### Bottomline

Well it's raining offers on international spends using credit and debit cards. Given that the trend for international vacation is increasing day by day, card companies are trying to tap this opportunity aggressively. I foresee an increase in number of such offers by card companies in future.
